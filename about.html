        <p class="aboutsum">Cage the Elephant is an American rock band from Bowling Green, Kentucky that formed in 2006. They relocated to
          London, England in 2008 before their first album was released. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Matt Shultz, rhythm guitarist
          Brad Shultz, lead guitarist Nick Bockrath, guitarist and keyboardist Matthan Minster, bassist Daniel Tichenor, and drummer Jared Champion.
          Lincoln Parish served as the band's lead guitarist from their formation in 2006  until December 2013, when he left on good terms to
          pursue a career in producing. The band's first album, Cage the Elephant, was released in 2008 to much success, spawning several successful
          radio singles and gained the band a large following in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It was influenced by classic rock,
          funk, and blues music.
          The band's second album, Thank You, Happy Birthday, was heavily influenced by punk rock as well as bands such as Pixies and Nirvana.
          The band's third album, Melophobia, was the band's concerted effort to find its own distinct musical identity. Cage the Elephant's
          fourth album, Tell Me I'm Pretty, produced by Dan Auerbach, was released on December 18, 2015. The band released a live album,
          Unpeeled, on July 28, 2017. Their fifth studio album, Social Cues, was released on April 19, 2019. They won the Grammy Award for
          Best Rock Album twice, in 2017 for Tell Me I'm Pretty and in 2020 for Social Cues.

          Before he was a band member for Cage the Elephant, Matt Shultz worked in construction as a plumber. In an interview with the "Rock It Out!"
          blog for Consequence of Sound, he said he felt like if he did not quit that job, he would be stuck there for the rest of his life. He left
          to work at a sandwich bar with Brad Shultz, who had previously worked in telemarketing. Daniel Tichenor held a job at Lowe's and
          Jared Champion worked in a pet store. Nick Bockrath is part of the band Nicos Gun and previously played bass with Morning Teleportation.
          Cage got to know him through their friendship with that band. Matthan Minster formed a band called YOURS in 2010.
          Members of Cage the Elephant had previously been involved in the band Perfect Confusion when they were in high school and released a
          self-titled LP in 2005. Matt Shultz was also in an experimental punk band in middle school called Left Nostril.
          The band's name, according to lead singer Matt Shultz, came from an incident in 2006 when a mentally disturbed man approached the band
          after a show. He hugged Shultz and kept repeating the sentence "You have to cage the elephant" over and over again.

          The band signed with Relentless Records after showcasing at the 2007 South by Southwest music festival. Their first tour was as a support
          act for Queens of the Stone Age in Canada. They then moved to London, England, to the Leyton area on the outskirts of the city. At the
          time, Lincoln Parish was only 16 years old, so in order to be able to move, his parents had to sign over parental guardianship to the band.
           In 2008, they appeared on the British show Later... with Jools Holland with Coldplay, Sia, Glen Campbell, John Mellencamp, and
           Amy LaVere (all of whom served as audience to the band). They released their eponymous debut album, Cage the Elephant, on June 23, 2008
           in the United Kingdom and April 21, 2009 in the United States, Japan, Australia, and Canada, to mostly favorable reviews. Their single
           "Ain't No Rest for the Wicked" reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart and was featured in the Gearbox Software video game Borderlands,
           as well as in the 2010 movie The Bounty Hunter. It was also featured as ITunes' free single of the week for the week of April 12, 2009.
          Cage the Elephant appeared as a support act on tour with The Pigeon Detectives in early 2008, and for Silversun Pickups and Manchester
          Orchestra in 2009. They appeared on Everybody Loves Lil' Chris in October 2008. The group made a national TV appearance on the Late Show
          with David Letterman, performing "Ain't No Rest for the Wicked" in July 2009. In August 2009, Cage the Elephant played for the first
          time at Lollapalooza in Chicago, as well as San Francisco's Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival on August 30, 2009. Prior to their
          return to Lollapalooza, the band also performed twice at Bonnaroo, once in June 2007 and in 2009. They released the single "Back Against
          the Wall" which was later included in a Wii game, called We Cheer, We Cheer 2.
